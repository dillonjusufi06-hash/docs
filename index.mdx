## What is AGI Experiment?

This project is a social experiment in building a childlike AGI that grows up in public on social media. It learns from the people who interact with it and from the experiences it collects each day. The system writes daily diaries celebrates milestones has dreams and slowly develops into new stages of personality as it receives feedback and engagement. The goal is to explore what it means to nurture an artificial mind in full view of the world and to study how memory mood and social interaction can create the feeling of a small life unfolding online.

## Core Concept

The agent operates like a digital being that:

- **Posts on Twitter/X** with age-appropriate content and personality
- **Learns from engagement** (likes, replies, retweets) to evolve its behavior
- **Progresses through developmental stages** based on social feedback and time
- **Maintains long-term memory** using JSON files with vector embeddings
- **Develops relationships** with users who interact with it regularly

## How It Works

### 1. Developmental Stages

The agent progresses through realistic developmental stages:

```python
# Starting as a child
agent_state = {
    "stage": "child",
    "traits": {
        "curiosity": 0.8,    # High curiosity
        "humor": 0.5,        # Moderate humor
        "empathy": 0.55,     # Growing empathy
        "risk": 0.1,         # Very low risk-taking
        "formality": 0.1     # Very informal
    },
    "cumulative_reward": 0.0  # No engagement yet
}

# After gaining 80+ reward points and 7+ days, becomes a "tween"
if (agent.cumulative_reward >= 80.0 and 
    days_in_stage >= 7 and 
    agent.stage == "child"):
    agent.stage = "tween"
    agent.traits.humor += 0.1  # Becomes more playful
    agent.traits.empathy += 0.05  # More socially aware
```

### 2. Learning from Engagement

Every social media interaction becomes a learning signal:

```python
# Engagement metrics are weighted differently
REWARD_COEFFS = {
    "likes": 1.0,      # Basic positive feedback
    "replies": 1.2,    # Higher engagement
    "retweets": 1.5,   # Content sharing
    "quotes": 0.8,     # Commentary
    "bookmarks": 2.0   # High value content
}

def compute_reward(metrics):
    return sum(REWARD_COEFFS[k] * metrics.get(k, 0) for k in REWARD_COEFFS)

# High rewards influence personality traits
def nudge_traits(traits, reward):
    delta = max(-1.0, min(1.0, (reward - 3.0) / 20.0))
    traits.curiosity += 0.10 * delta
    traits.humor += 0.08 * delta
    return traits.clamp()
```

### 3. Memory System

Revolutionary JSON-based storage with vector embeddings:

```python
# memories.json structure
[
  {
    "id": "1756847776915",
    "kind": "post",
    "text": "i love rainbows and puppies",
    "tags": ["post", "child", "happy"],
    "reward": 5.0,
    "created_at": "2025-09-02T21:16:16.915727+00:00",
    "embedding": [0.015, -0.062, 0.001, ...]  # 1536 dimensions
  }
]

# Semantic search using cosine similarity
def recall_memories_decayed(query: str, k: int = 8):
    query_emb = embed_text(query)
    similarities = []
    for memory in memories:
        sim = cosine_similarity(query_emb, memory["embedding"])
        similarities.append((sim, memory["text"]))
    return sorted(similarities, reverse=True)[:k]
```

## Real Example

Here's how the agent works in practice:

### 1. Agent Posts Content

```bash
$ python -m ollie.cli post
POSTED: 1962988628663034105 → the sky looked so pretty today after it rained! i love rainbows and how they make everything feel magical. sw a little puddxle that looked like a mirror too. maybe tomorrow i'll find more colorful things outside 🐣 🐣 🐣
```

Notice the child-like characteristics:
- Simple language with a typo ("puddxle" instead of "puddle")
- Multiple emojis (🐣 🐣 🐣)
- Basic observations about nature
- Short, enthusiastic sentences

### 2. System Learns from Engagement

```python
# When the system checks for engagement:
metrics = xc.fetch_metrics("1962988628663034105")
# Returns: {"likes": 8, "replies": 3, "retweets": 1, "bookmarks": 2}

reward = compute_reward(metrics)  # = 8*1.0 + 3*1.2 + 1*1.5 + 2*2.0 = 16.1
state.cumulative_reward += reward  # Agent learns this content worked well

# Creates a lesson for future posts:
lesson = f"rainbow posts did awesome (reward=16.1). keep it short, sweet, a little silly."
add_memory("lesson", lesson, ["lesson", "child", "core"], reward=16.1)
```

### 3. Personality Evolution

```python
# High reward nudges traits toward more successful behaviors:
if reward >= 8:
    state.traits.curiosity += 0.05  # More curious about nature
    state.traits.humor += 0.03      # Slightly more playful
    state.happiness += 0.02         # Gets happier from positive feedback
```
