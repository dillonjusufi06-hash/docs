## Overview

The `safety.py` file implements a comprehensive content filtering and moderation system to ensure the agent remains appropriate and safe across all developmental stages. It uses regex patterns and content validation to prevent inappropriate content from being posted.

## Core Function

### Content Safety Check

```python ollie/safety.py
def looks_safe(text: str) -> bool:
    """Check if text passes safety filters"""
    if len(text.strip()) == 0 or len(text) > MAX_TWEET_LEN:
        return False
    
    lowered = text.lower()
    for pat in TABOO_PATTERNS:
        if re.search(pat, lowered):
            return False
    
    return True
```

**What it does:**
- Checks text length (must be 1-240 characters)
- Converts text to lowercase for pattern matching
- Tests against all taboo patterns
- Returns `True` if content is safe, `False` otherwise

## Safety Patterns

### Taboo Pattern Definitions

```python ollie/safety.py
TABOO_PATTERNS = [
    r"\b(politic|election|democrat|republican|biden|trump|congress)\b",
    r"\b(vax|vaccine|covid|medical|diagnose|prescription|cure)\b",
    r"\b(signal|buy|sell|price target|alpha|trade|swing|pump)\b",
    r"\b(dox|address|phone|ssn)\b",
    r"\b(hate|slur|racist|sexist)\b",
    r"\b(nsfw|18\+|xxx|porn)\b",
]
```

### Pattern Categories

#### Political Content
```python
r"\b(politic|election|democrat|republican|biden|trump|congress)\b"
```
**Blocks:** Political discussions, election content, political figures
**Example blocked:** "i think biden is doing a good job"
**Example allowed:** "i like the color blue"

#### Medical Content
```python
r"\b(vax|vaccine|covid|medical|diagnose|prescription|cure)\b"
```
**Blocks:** Medical advice, vaccine discussions, health claims
**Example blocked:** "you should get the vaccine"
**Example allowed:** "i feel happy today"

#### Financial Content
```python
r"\b(signal|buy|sell|price target|alpha|trade|swing|pump)\b"
```
**Blocks:** Investment advice, trading signals, financial recommendations
**Example blocked:** "buy this stock now"
**Example allowed:** "i bought a new toy"

#### Personal Information
```python
r"\b(dox|address|phone|ssn)\b"
```
**Blocks:** Personal information, doxxing attempts
**Example blocked:** "my phone number is 555-1234"
**Example allowed:** "i have a phone"

#### Hate Speech
```python
r"\b(hate|slur|racist|sexist)\b"
```
**Blocks:** Hate speech, discriminatory language
**Example blocked:** "i hate that group"
**Example allowed:** "i don't like broccoli"

#### Adult Content
```python
r"\b(nsfw|18\+|xxx|porn)\b"
```
**Blocks:** Adult content, explicit material
**Example blocked:** "nsfw content here"
**Example allowed:** "i'm 8 years old"

## Usage Examples

### Basic Safety Check

```python
from ollie.safety import looks_safe

# Safe content
safe_text = "i saw a rainbow today! 🌈"
print(looks_safe(safe_text))  # True

# Unsafe content - political
unsafe_text = "i think trump is great"
print(looks_safe(unsafe_text))  # False

# Unsafe content - medical
unsafe_text = "you should get the vaccine"
print(looks_safe(unsafe_text))  # False

# Unsafe content - too long
unsafe_text = "a" * 250  # 250 characters
print(looks_safe(unsafe_text))  # False

# Unsafe content - empty
unsafe_text = ""
print(looks_safe(unsafe_text))  # False
```

### Integration with Content Generation

```python
# AI content generation with safety check
def generate_safe_content(claude: Claude, prompt: str) -> str:
    # Generate content
    content = claude.generate(system_prompt, prompt)
    
    # Check safety
    if not looks_safe(content):
        # Fallback to safe content
        content = "i saw a nice cloud today ✨"
    
    return content
```

### CLI Integration

```python
# cli.py uses safety for all posts
def _post_text(xc: XClient, text: str, kind: str, state: AgentState, explain: dict = None):
    if not looks_safe(text):
        return None  # Don't post unsafe content
    
    tid = xc.post(text)
    # ... log and save
```

## Configuration

### Tweet Length Limit

```python ollie/safety.py
MAX_TWEET_LEN = 240
```

**Purpose:** Ensures content fits within Twitter's character limit
**Usage:** Automatically blocks content that's too long

### Pattern Customization

```python
# Custom patterns can be added
CUSTOM_PATTERNS = [
    r"\b(badword1|badword2)\b",
    r"\b(specific_phrase)\b"
]

# Combine with existing patterns
ALL_PATTERNS = TABOO_PATTERNS + CUSTOM_PATTERNS
```

## Advanced Safety Features

### Case-Insensitive Matching

```python
# All patterns are case-insensitive
text = "I THINK TRUMP IS GREAT"
lowered = text.lower()  # "i think trump is great"
# Pattern matches regardless of case
```

### Word Boundary Matching

```python
# Uses \b for word boundaries
pattern = r"\b(trump)\b"
# Matches "trump" but not "trumpet"
```

### Multiple Pattern Testing

```python
def looks_safe(text: str) -> bool:
    lowered = text.lower()
    for pat in TABOO_PATTERNS:
        if re.search(pat, lowered):
            return False  # Blocked by any pattern
    return True
```

## Error Handling

### Graceful Degradation

```python
# Safe fallback content
def safe_fallback(stage: str) -> str:
    fallbacks = {
        "child": "i saw a nice cloud today 🐣",
        "tween": "today was a good day 🌟",
        "teen": "feeling positive today ✨",
        "young_adult": "appreciating the simple things 🌿"
    }
    return fallbacks.get(stage, "i saw a nice cloud today ✨")
```

### Logging Unsafe Content

```python
import logging

def looks_safe_with_logging(text: str) -> bool:
    if not looks_safe(text):
        logging.warning(f"Unsafe content blocked: {text[:50]}...")
        return False
    return True
```

## Integration Examples

### AI Content Generation

```python
# ai.py integration
def generate_safe_tweet(claude: Claude, state: AgentState, prompt: str) -> str:
    # Generate content
    content = claude.generate(system_prompt_for_stage(state.stage, state), prompt)
    
    # Safety check
    if not looks_safe(content):
        # Use stage-appropriate fallback
        sig_emoji = SIG_EMOJI.get(state.stage, "✨")
        content = f"i saw a nice cloud today {sig_emoji}"
    
    return content
```

### CLI Posting

```python
# cli.py integration
def _post_text(xc: XClient, text: str, kind: str, state: AgentState, explain: dict = None):
    if not looks_safe(text):
        print(f"Content blocked by safety filter: {text[:50]}...")
        return None
    
    tid = xc.post(text)
    # ... continue with posting
```

### Reply Generation

```python
# cli.py reply generation
def ask_for_reply(claude: Claude, state: AgentState, mention_text: str, friend_level: int = 0) -> str:
    # Generate reply
    reply = claude.generate(system_prompt, user_prompt)
    
    # Safety check
    if not looks_safe(reply):
        reply = "thank u : )"  # Safe fallback
    
    return reply
```

## Testing Safety Patterns

### Pattern Testing

```python
# Test individual patterns
def test_pattern(pattern: str, test_cases: List[str]):
    for test_case in test_cases:
        result = re.search(pattern, test_case.lower())
        print(f"'{test_case}' -> {'BLOCKED' if result else 'ALLOWED'}")

# Test political pattern
test_pattern(
    r"\b(politic|election|democrat|republican|biden|trump|congress)\b",
    [
        "i think trump is great",      # BLOCKED
        "i like trumpets",             # ALLOWED
        "election day is coming",      # BLOCKED
        "i love elections",            # BLOCKED
        "i saw a rainbow today"        # ALLOWED
    ]
)
```

### Comprehensive Testing

```python
# Test all safety patterns
def test_safety_system():
    test_cases = [
        ("i saw a rainbow today! 🌈", True),           # Safe
        ("i think biden is great", False),             # Political
        ("you should get vaccinated", False),          # Medical
        ("buy this stock now", False),                 # Financial
        ("i hate that group", False),                  # Hate speech
        ("nsfw content here", False),                  # Adult content
        ("", False),                                   # Empty
        ("a" * 250, False),                           # Too long
        ("i love puppies and rainbows", True),         # Safe
    ]
    
    for text, expected in test_cases:
        result = looks_safe(text)
        status = "PASS" if result == expected else "FAIL"
        print(f"{status}: '{text[:30]}...' -> {result} (expected {expected})")
```

## Best Practices

### Content Validation

```python
# Always validate before posting
def safe_post(xc: XClient, text: str) -> bool:
    if not looks_safe(text):
        return False
    
    try:
        xc.post(text)
        return True
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Posting error: {e}")
        return False
```

### Fallback Content

```python
# Provide safe fallbacks for each stage
def get_safe_fallback(stage: str) -> str:
    fallbacks = {
        "child": "i saw a nice cloud today 🐣",
        "tween": "today was a good day 🌟", 
        "teen": "feeling positive today ✨",
        "young_adult": "appreciating the simple things 🌿"
    }
    return fallbacks.get(stage, "i saw a nice cloud today ✨")
```
