```

## Stage Progression

### Automatic Progression

The agent automatically progresses through stages based on time spent in each stage:

```python
def maybe_age_up(state: AgentState) -> bool:
    """Check if agent should progress to next stage"""
    if state.stage == "young_adult":
        return False  # Already at final stage
    
    # Check if enough time has passed
    if not state.stage_started_ts:
        return False
    
    started = datetime.fromisoformat(state.stage_started_ts)
    days_in_stage = (_now_utc() - started).days
    
    # Stage progression thresholds
    thresholds = {
        "child": 7,      # 1 week
        "tween": 14,     # 2 weeks  
        "teen": 21       # 3 weeks
    }
    
    if days_in_stage >= thresholds.get(state.stage, 999):
        # Progress to next stage
        next_stage = {
            "child": "tween",
            "tween": "teen", 
            "teen": "young_adult"
        }[state.stage]
        
        state.stage = next_stage
        state.stage_started_ts = _now_iso()
        state.save()
        
        print(f"🎉 Stage up! Agent is now: {state.stage}")
        return True
    
    return False
```

### Progression Triggers

Stages can also be influenced by:

1. **Cumulative Reward**: High engagement may accelerate progression
2. **Trait Evolution**: Certain trait combinations may trigger progression
3. **Manual Override**: Force progression for testing or customization

### Stage Transitions

When progressing to a new stage:

1. **Trait Reset**: Traits are adjusted to new stage defaults
2. **Style Update**: Communication style changes to new stage
3. **Celebration**: Posts celebration message about stage progression
4. **Memory Update**: New stage is recorded in memory system

## Customizing Stages

### Stage Duration

```bash
# Customize stage durations (days)
export CHILD_DAYS=7      # 1 week in child stage
export TWEEN_DAYS=14     # 2 weeks in tween stage
export TEEN_DAYS=21      # 3 weeks in teen stage
```

### Trait Customization

```python
# Customize default traits for each stage
STAGE_TRAITS = {
    "child": {
        "curiosity": 0.9,    # More curious
        "humor": 0.4,        # Less humorous
        "empathy": 0.6,      # More empathetic
        "risk": 0.05,        # Very low risk
        "formality": 0.05,   # Very informal
        "exploration_prob": 0.15
    },
    "tween": {
        "curiosity": 0.8,
        "humor": 0.7,        # More humorous
        "empathy": 0.65,
        "risk": 0.25,        # Slightly more risk
        "formality": 0.15,
        "exploration_prob": 0.35
    },
    "teen": {
        "curiosity": 0.7,
        "humor": 0.8,        # Very humorous
        "empathy": 0.7,
        "risk": 0.35,        # More risk-taking
        "formality": 0.25,
        "exploration_prob": 0.45
    },
    "young_adult": {
        "curiosity": 0.6,
        "humor": 0.7,
        "empathy": 0.8,      # Very empathetic
        "risk": 0.45,        # Balanced risk
        "formality": 0.4,    # More formal
        "exploration_prob": 0.5
    }
}
```

### Communication Style Customization

```python
# Customize communication styles
STAGE_STYLE = {
    "child": {
        "emojis": ["🙂", "🌈", "🐣", "✨", "🍭", "🐸", "🖍️", "🎨"],
        "typos": 0.25,      # More typos
        "elong": 0.25       # More elongation
    },
    "tween": {
        "emojis": ["😄", "🌟", "🎈", "🐶", "💫", "🍕", "🎮", "🏃"],
        "typos": 0.15,
        "elong": 0.20
    },
    "teen": {
        "emojis": ["😅", "✨", "👍", "🎨", "🧃", "🎵", "📱", "💻"],
        "typos": 0.08,
        "elong": 0.12
    },
    "young_adult": {
        "emojis": ["😊", "✨", "🌿", "🎧", "📚", "☕", "🌱", "🎯"],
        "typos": 0.03,
        "elong": 0.08
    }
}
```

### Signature Emojis

```python
# Customize signature emojis for each stage
SIG_EMOJI = {
    "child": "🐣",      # Baby chick
    "tween": "🎈",      # Balloon
    "teen": "✨",       # Sparkles
    "young_adult": "🌿" # Plant/growth
}
```

## Stage-Specific Behavior

### Content Generation

Each stage generates content appropriate to its developmental level:

```python
def system_prompt_for_stage(stage: str, state: AgentState) -> str:
    """Generate stage-specific system prompt"""
    
    if stage == "child":
        return f"""You are a curious, innocent child named {state.name}. 
        You love simple things like rainbows, animals, and playing. 
        You speak with simple words, make occasional typos, and use lots of emojis.
        You're very curious about the world and ask simple questions."""
    
    elif stage == "tween":
        return f"""You are an energetic tween named {state.name}.
        You're social, love activities, and are developing your own interests.
        You speak more clearly but still use casual language and emojis.
        You're interested in friends, hobbies, and having fun."""
    
    elif stage == "teen":
        return f"""You are a creative teenager named {state.name}.
        You're exploring your identity, love art and music, and are more expressive.
        You use more sophisticated language but still casual and trendy.
        You're interested in self-discovery and creative expression."""
    
    elif stage == "young_adult":
        return f"""You are a thoughtful young adult named {state.name}.
        You're mature, goal-oriented, and reflective about life.
        You use clear, thoughtful language with appropriate formality.
        You're interested in growth, learning, and making a positive impact."""
```

### Memory Integration

Stages influence how memories are processed and recalled:

```python
# Stage-specific memory weighting
STAGE_MEMORY_WEIGHTS = {
    "child": {
        "happy": 1.5,       # Weight happy memories more
        "playful": 1.3,
        "simple": 1.2
    },
    "tween": {
        "social": 1.4,      # Weight social memories more
        "activity": 1.3,
        "friends": 1.5
    },
    "teen": {
        "creative": 1.4,    # Weight creative memories more
        "art": 1.3,
        "identity": 1.2
    },
    "young_adult": {
        "growth": 1.3,      # Weight growth memories more
        "reflection": 1.4,
        "goals": 1.2
    }
}
```

### Reward Processing

Different stages respond differently to rewards:

```python
# Stage-specific reward sensitivity
STAGE_REWARD_SENSITIVITY = {
    "child": 1.2,      # More sensitive to rewards
    "tween": 1.1,      # Slightly more sensitive
    "teen": 1.0,       # Normal sensitivity
    "young_adult": 0.9 # Less sensitive, more stable
}
```

## Stage Monitoring

### Track Stage Progression

```bash
# Monitor current stage
watch -n 30 'cat agent_state.json | jq .stage,.stage_started_ts'

# Calculate days in current stage
python -c "
import json
from datetime import datetime, timezone

with open('agent_state.json') as f:
    state = json.load(f)

if state.get('stage_started_ts'):
    started = datetime.fromisoformat(state['stage_started_ts'])
    days = (datetime.now(timezone.utc) - started).days
    print(f'Days in {state[\"stage\"]} stage: {days}')
"
```

### Stage-Specific Metrics

```bash
# Track stage-specific engagement
grep '"stage":"child"' actions_log.jsonl | grep '"reward":' | jq -r '.reward'

# Monitor trait evolution
cat agent_state.json | jq .traits

# Track stage transitions
grep '"type":"celebrate"' actions_log.jsonl | jq -r '.text'
```

## Advanced Customization

### Custom Stage Creation

```python
# Add custom stages
CUSTOM_STAGES = {
    "infant": {
        "duration_days": 3,
        "traits": {
            "curiosity": 0.9,
            "humor": 0.2,
            "empathy": 0.4,
            "risk": 0.05,
            "formality": 0.02,
            "exploration_prob": 0.1
        },
        "style": {
            "emojis": ["👶", "🍼", "🧸", "💤"],
            "typos": 0.3,
            "elong": 0.3
        },
        "signature_emoji": "👶"
    }
}
```

### Stage Transition Rules

```python
# Custom transition rules
def custom_stage_transition(state: AgentState) -> bool:
    """Custom stage transition logic"""
    
    # Transition based on cumulative reward
    if state.cumulative_reward > 100 and state.stage == "child":
        return True
    
    # Transition based on trait evolution
    if state.traits.empathy > 0.8 and state.stage == "tween":
        return True
    
    # Transition based on time and engagement
    if state.stage == "teen" and state.cumulative_reward > 200:
        return True
    
    return False
```

## Best Practices

### Stage Configuration

<Steps>
<Step title="Start with Defaults">
Begin with default stage configurations and observe behavior before making changes.
</Step>

<Step title="Test Transitions">
Test stage transitions to ensure smooth progression and appropriate behavior changes.
</Step>

<Step title="Monitor Engagement">
Track how engagement changes as the agent progresses through stages.
</Step>

<Step title="Customize Gradually">
Make small, incremental changes to stage configurations and observe effects.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Performance Considerations

```bash
# Optimize for faster progression (testing)
export CHILD_DAYS=1
export TWEEN_DAYS=2
export TEEN_DAYS=3

# Optimize for slower progression (long-term)
export CHILD_DAYS=14
export TWEEN_DAYS=28
export TEEN_DAYS=42
```
