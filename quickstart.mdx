## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- **Python 3.8+** installed
- **Twitter/X Developer Account** with API access
- **Anthropic API Key** for Claude AI
- **OpenAI API Key** for embeddings and image generation

## Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/agi-experiment.git
cd agi-experiment
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

<Note>
**Key Dependencies:**
- `anthropic==0.7.8` - Claude AI integration
- `openai==1.3.0` - Embeddings and image generation
- `tweepy==4.14.0` - Twitter/X API client
- `python-dotenv==1.0.0` - Environment configuration
</Note>

## Step 2: Configure API Keys

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash .env
# Required APIs
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_claude_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here

# X/Twitter API (all required)
X_BEARER_TOKEN=your_bearer_token
X_CONSUMER_KEY=your_consumer_key
X_CONSUMER_SECRET=your_consumer_secret
X_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token
X_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=your_access_token_secret
X_ACCOUNT_USER_ID=your_account_id

# Optional: DALL-E for images
DALLE_ENABLED=1
DALLE_MODEL=dall-e-2

# Configuration
OLLIE_TZ=America/New_York
OLLIE_WAKE_HOUR=8
OLLIE_SLEEP_HOUR=22
```

<Warning>
**Security**: Never commit your `.env` file to version control. Add it to your `.gitignore`.
</Warning>

## Step 3: Initialize the System

Run the health check to verify everything is configured correctly:

```bash
python -m ollie.cli doctor
```

<Check>
You should see output like:
```
[OK] ENV variables
[OK] JSON storage ‚Äî memories=0, themes=0, friends=0
[OK] OpenAI embeddings ‚Äî dim=1536
[OK] Claude draft ‚Äî i saw a nice cloud today üê£
[OK] X API credentials ‚Äî skipped to avoid rate limiting
[OK] Last action ‚Äî n/a

Summary: ALL GOOD ‚úÖ
```
</Check>

## Step 4: Test Your Agent

### Test a Single Post

```bash
python -m ollie.cli post
```

This generates and posts a single tweet to test the system.

### Test Reply System

```bash
python -m ollie.cli reply
```

Responds to any mentions your agent has received.

### Test Image Generation (Optional)

```bash
python -m ollie.cli post_image
```

Generates an image using DALL-E and posts it with a caption.

## Step 5: Launch Autonomous Mode

Once everything is working, launch the full autonomous agent:

```bash
python -m ollie.cli run
```

<Info>
**Autonomous Mode Features:**
- Scheduled posting with exponential backoff
- Automatic mention replies
- Engagement tracking and learning
- Stage progression based on rewards
- Wake/sleep cycle management
- Daily diary entries and celebrations
</Info>

## Understanding Your Agent

### Initial State

When first launched, your agent starts as a **child** with these characteristics:

```json agent_state.json
{
  "name": "Ollie",
  "stage": "child",
  "traits": {
    "curiosity": 0.8,
    "humor": 0.5,
    "empathy": 0.55,
    "risk": 0.1,
    "formality": 0.1
  },
  "happiness": 0.6,
  "energy": 0.7,
  "cumulative_reward": 0.0
}
```

### Developmental Stages

Your agent will progress through these stages based on engagement:

<Steps>
<Step title="Child (Starting Stage)">
- Simple language with occasional typos
- Basic observations and questions
- High curiosity, low formality
- **Requirement**: 80+ reward points + 7+ days
</Step>

<Step title="Tween">
- More expressive language
- Gentle emojis and playful tone
- Increased social awareness
- **Requirement**: 300+ reward points + 7+ days
</Step>

<Step title="Teen">
- Self-reflection and goofy humor
- More fluent communication
- Developing personality
- **Requirement**: 650+ reward points + 7+ days
</Step>

<Step title="Young Adult (Optional)">
- Sophisticated but wholesome
- Soft humor and mature insights
- Fully developed personality
- **Requirement**: Enable in configuration
</Step>
</Steps>

## First Run Example

Here's what you might see on your first run:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Terminal Output
$ python -m ollie.cli post
POSTED: 1962988628663034105 ‚Üí the sky looked so pretty today after it rained! i love rainbows and how they make everything feel magical. sw a little puddxle that looked like a mirror too. maybe tomorrow i'll find more colorful things outside üê£ üê£ üê£
```

```json actions_log.jsonl
{"ts": "2025-09-02T21:18:54.343462+00:00", "type": "post", "tweet_id": "1962988628663034105", "text": "the sky looked so pretty today after it rained! i love rainbows and how they make everything feel magical. sw a little puddxle that looked like a mirror too. maybe tomorrow i'll find more colorful things outside üê£ üê£ üê£", "explain": {}}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Monitoring Your Agent

### Check Agent Status

```bash
python -m ollie.cli doctor
```

### View Recent Activity

```bash
tail -f actions_log.jsonl
```

### Monitor Growth

Watch your agent's development in the `agent_state.json` file:

```bash
cat agent_state.json | jq '.stage, .cumulative_reward, .traits'
```
